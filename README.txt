# Basic Preparation
1. Change directory to the project directory: `cd <path_to_project_dir>`
2. Set PYTHONPATH environment variable to point to the `<path_to_project_dir>`
3. Install Python 3 and the required libraries
    - During the development, we used Python 3.5
    - Libraries needed are listed in `<path_to_project_dir>/requirements.txt`
    - These libraries can be installed using `pip install <path_to_project_dir>/requirements.txt`
        - Recommended to use a Linux based OS / MacOS since Theano is quite hard to install on Windows


# Data Split Preparation
1. Run `python3 <path_to_project_dir>/data_split_util.py`
2. This will generate a `<path_to_project_dir>/data_split.pkl` file which contains the split dataset
    - **Please change the splitting ratio according to which experiments you are trying to do!**
    - For using NN ensemble:
        - Each individual model is trained using 40% of the data
        - Each individual model will have to perform rating predictions for another set of 40% of the data
            - These rating predictions will be used as the training data for the *ENSEMBLE* Neural Network

        - Each individual model will have to perform rating predictions for the last 20% of the data
            - These rating predictions will be used to get the final MSE or RMSE value of the *ENSEMBLE* Neural Network

     - For using Averaging ensemble:
        - Each individual model is trained using 70% of the data
        - Each individual model will have to perform rating predictions for the last 30% of the data
        - The Averaging ensemble model will do averaging on the predicted ratings of the last 30% of the data generated by each individual model


# Training and Prediction
1. There are 5 main folders for this project: `edwin, ensemble, kenrick, martinus, model`
    - Please note that this folder organization is NOT to show who do which models and who did more work, etc.
    - This organization is used just to easily find out who is doing what during our development and we will leave it as it is rather than reorganizing the whole project directory

2. Each folder contains codes for training models and predicting using the models
    - Each folder will have a README.txt which describes how to use the code

3. Before running any of the model training or prediction code, please change directory to the directory which contains the Python file.
    - For example, if I want to run the code for training a Random Forest Full model:
        - Change directory to that directory: `cd <path_to_project_dir>/edwin/rf_full`
        - Read the README.txt in the parent directory: `<path_to_project_dir>/edwin/README.txt`
        - Find out how to train and/or predict using a particular model

4. IMPORTANT NOTE: For ensemble model, please ensure that all intermediary rating prediction results generated by each individual model have been generated (by training and run prediction for each individual model)!
