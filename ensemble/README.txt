## Neural Network and Averaging Ensemble Method


## Requirements
- Python 3
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Lasagne
- Theano


## Setup
1. Ensure that all intermediary rating prediction results generated by each individual model have been generated (by training and run prediction for each individual model)
2. The neural network should be trained only using set B (which is 40% of the full data) and tested using set C (which is 20% of the full data)
3. The averaging method can be tested using set C and it does not need any training
4. Change the variable `handlers` to specify which intermediary rating prediction results should be used


## Training and Predicting:
Neural Network: `python3 nn.py`
Averaging: `python3 averaging.py`
